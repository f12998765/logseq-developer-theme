[‰∏≠ÊñáÁâà](readme-zh.md)

[logseq-developer-theme](https://github.com/UNICKCHENG/logseq-developer-theme) is a secondary development of the [logseq-dev-theme](https://github.com/pengx17/logseq-dev-theme) theme as an upstream, and you can easily see the `@import` reference in [main.scss](scss/main.scss) . You can clearly compare the differences between [logseq-dev-theme](https://pengx17.github.io/knowledge-garden/) and [logseq-developer-theme](https://docs.unickcheng.cc) via respective website [^1][^2], for more information see [this article](https://docs.unickcheng.cc/#/page/logseq-developer-theme).

**logseq-developer-theme will not be made into logseq-dev-theme 2.0**, just because logseq-dev-theme allows me to focus more on the desired css style, therefore, this project is not a fork, but a reference via `@import`.

For the record, I don't have any experience in front-end development, but the best method to start learning is with a project. Although [scss](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax) is not very complicated, the code I wrote was really ugly. So I will keep improving the code and you can also remind me at [issues](https://github.com/UNICKCHENG/logseq-developer-theme/issues) or pull request. 


## üéâUsage

Using the jsDelivr CDN to get theme styles , simply add the following code to your `custom.css`. 

```css
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/unickcheng/logseq-developer-theme@release/custom.css")
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that the jsDelivr CDN provides a faster service, but may not be able to refresh the latest version in time [^3]

## üöÄ¬†Local development

**step 1 > Verify the local environment**
```bash
node -v
npm -v
git -v
```

**step 2 > Install dependencies**
```bash
# > step 1 download source code
git clone https://github.com/UNICKCHENG/logseq-developer-theme.git
cd logseq-developer-theme
# > step 2 installing dependencies
npm install
```

**step 3 > Modify  `package.json`**
- please modify value of `localPath` to the address of your logseq graph documentation
```
{
	...
    "config": {
        "localPath": "C:\\Users\\hi\\LocalStation\\BLOG\\docs"
    },
	...
}
```
‚ö†Ô∏è The purpose here is to make it easier to compile the SCSS output directly to `../logseq/custom.css`

**step 4 > Running**
```bash
# windows
npm run dev:win

# Mac or Linux
npm run dev
```
