[‰∏≠ÊñáÁâà](readme-zh.md)

[logseq-developer-theme](https://github.com/UNICKCHENG/logseq-developer-theme) is a secondary development of the [logseq-dev-theme](https://github.com/pengx17/logseq-dev-theme) theme as an upstream, and you can easily see the `@import` reference in [main.scss](scss/main.scss) . You can clearly compare the differences between [logseq-dev-theme](https://pengx17.github.io/knowledge-garden/) and [logseq-developer-theme](https://docs.unickcheng.cc) via respective website [^1] [^2], for more information see [this article](https://docs.unickcheng.cc/#/page/logseq-developer-theme).

**logseq-developer-theme will not be made into logseq-dev-theme 2.0**, just because logseq-dev-theme allows me to focus more on the desired css style, therefore, this project is not a fork, but a reference via `@import`.

For the record, I don't have any experience in front-end development, but the best method to start learning is with a project. Although [scss](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax) is not very complicated, the code I wrote was really ugly. So I will keep improving the code and you can also remind me at [issues](https://github.com/UNICKCHENG/logseq-developer-theme/issues) or pull request.

If you can't download it from the plugin marketplace, you can download it from  [GitHub Release](https://github.com/UNICKCHENG/logseq-developer-theme/releases) , unzip it, and then import it into logseq

üìå Starting with version 1.0.0, GitHub Release or Plugin Marketplace downloads are supported for offline use. Because it will download fonts and other dependencies together to the local `~/.logseq/plugins` directory.

## üöÄ¬†Local development

**step 1 > Verify the local environment**
```bash
node -v
npm -v
git -v
```

**step 2 > Install dependencies**
```bash
# > step 1 download source code
git clone https://github.com/UNICKCHENG/logseq-developer-theme.git
